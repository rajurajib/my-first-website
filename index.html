            <H2>All about pharaoh</H2>
            <p>The Pharaoh in ancient Egypt was the political and religious leader of the people and held the titles 'Lord of the Two Lands' and 'High Priest of Every Temple'. The word 'pharaoh' is the Greek form of the Egyptian pero or per-a-a, which was the designation for the royal residence and means `Great House'.</p>
            <p>In 3150 BCE the First Dynasty appeared in Egypt with the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt by the king Menes (c. 3150 BCE, now believed to be Narmer). Menes/Narmer is depicted on inscriptions wearing the two crowns of Egypt, signifying unification, and his reign was thought to be in accordance with the will of the gods; but the office of the king itself was not associated with the divine until later.</p>

            <h2>About king of sea poseidon</h2>
            <p>The mighty Earthshaker, Poseidon ruled the waves that the ancient seafaring Greeks depended upon. Fisherman and sea captains swore fealty to him and avoided his wrath; the sea god's persecution of the hero Odysseus was well known, and few wished to wander so far and so long before finding their home port. In addition to his influence over the seas, Poseidon was responsible for earthquakes, striking the ground with his trident, a three-pronged spear, to awesomely devastating effect.</p>
            <p>Poseidon was the son of the titan Cronos and brother to the Olympian gods Zeus and Hades. Cronos, fearful of a son who would overthrow him as he vanquished his own father Ouranos, swallowed each of his children as they were born. Like his brother Hades, he grew up inside the bowels of Cronos, until the day when Zeus tricked the titan into vomiting up his siblings. Emerging victorious after the ensuing battle, Poseidon, Zeus, and Hades drew lots to divide up the world they had gained. Poseidon won dominion over the waters and all its creatures.</p>

            <h2>All achievement of pharaoh</h2>
            <p>As a statesman, the pharaoh made laws, waged war, collected taxes, and oversaw all the land in Egypt (which was owned by the pharaoh). Many scholars believe the first pharaoh was Narmer, also called MenesTwo of ancient Egypts greatest achievements were hieroglyphic writing and the pyramids. The ancient Egyptians made a kind of paper from the stalks of a reed called papyrus, or paper plant.</p>

            <h2>All achievement of poseidon</h2>
            <p>Poseidon is the second greatest of the 12 Greek gods of Olympus, he is the ruler of the sea, earthquakes and is known as the fertility god. Even though Poseidon is one of the supreme rulers in Olympus the sea is his domain. He was worshipped as an Olympian god during the Bronze Age in Greece (the second millennium). Poseidon is the brother of Hades and Zeus, “divided the power of the world” (Sellers). They all took their places, Zeus ruled the sky while hades controlled the underworld. “Poseidon received the sea as his domain” and all its water both fresh and salt (Felson). Poseidon is also the creator of all sea creatures and he can control them with the mercy of his will. With this in mind, I would like you to in vision Poseidon the great god as the image for a Trident fishing spear.</p>
